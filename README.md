(a) Observation Task Interface: This interface includes only the height adjustment function. An instruction panel displays task descriptions and timing information in front of the workspace. (b) Drawing Task Interface: This interface offers height adjustment, color change, redo, undo, and eraser functions. An instruction panel presents task descriptions and timing in front of the workspace. (c) Data Collection Mode Interface: By default, this interface uses a blue color scheme and includes functions for changing the terrain model and saving data.
# Target users
Sketch2Terrain empowers non-experts to create concise and unambiguous sketch maps of natural environments. The system also serves as a comprehensive tool for researchers, providing a unified interface that supports the entire research workflow, including data collection, material preparation, and experimentation.
