# Sketch2Terrain
Sketch2Terrain is a AI-Driven Real-Time Universal-Style Terrain Sketch Mapping in AR. Sketch mapping is an established research tool to study human spatial decision-making and information processing by externalizing one's spatial knowledge through sketches. We present Sketch2Terrain, an advanced generative 3D sketch mapping system that revolutionizes how we create sketch maps using Augmented Reality (AR). Sketch2Terrain introduces a pipeline that combines freehand mid-air sketching to create connected curve networks with generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), enabling the real-time generation of realistic and high-fidelity 3D terrain in under 100 milliseconds. 

![Alt text](/images/Teasor.png?raw=true "We presents generative sketch mapping, a technique that allows non-expert users to depict complex surfaces (e.g., terrain) from their memory. We implement this technique using Sketch2Terrain, a generative AI-driven real-time 3D sketch-mapping AR interface. (a) The setup for the interface needs a Mixed Reality (MR) headset, controllers, a liftable table for individual differences, and a chair with castors to allow a change of perspective. (b) Users can observe a terrain model and memorize its structure. (c) In the sketch mapping task, the terrain model disappears and users use Sketch2Terrain to draw the spatial environment from memory. (d) A generative AI model is developed to convert the 3D curves into shapes for better visualization and to facilitate easier and faster recalling. The user iteratively repeats (c) and (d) for a more accurate result, as in the action sequence shown from $\text{T}_\text{1}$ through $\text{T}_\text{N}$.")

# Target users
Sketch2Terrain empowers non-experts to create concise and unambiguous sketch maps of natural environments. The system also serves as a comprehensive tool for researchers, providing a unified interface that supports the entire research workflow, including data collection, material preparation, and experimentation.
